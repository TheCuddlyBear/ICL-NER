Algorithm: Naive Bayes
dummy Chunker features designed to test the Chunker class for correctness
        - the POS tag of the word
        - the entire history of IOB tags so far

       - If the word contains any capital letters
       - The word length
       - The POS-tags
       - History of previous IOB tags in the sentence

    :param sentence: List of (word, pos) tuples
    :param i: Index of words in sentence
    :param history: List of previous IOB tags
    :return: Feature dictionary

    This function uses a window of 2 words, which means it looks to the given word, the word before
    and the word after. This function looks at 11 features:
        - The word in lowercase
        - If the word is in a list of common Dutch names
        - The suffix of the word
        - If the word is all caps
        - If the word starts with a capital letter
        - If it contains a dot (.)
        - If it contains a hyphen (-)
        - Shape of the word (Ccd)
        - The POS-tags
        - History of previous IOB tags in the sentence

    ChunkParse score:
    IOB Accuracy:  94.3%%
    Precision:     47.8%%
    Recall:        62.2%%
    F-Measure:     54.0%%
